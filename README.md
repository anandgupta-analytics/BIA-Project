Comparative Healthcare Analytics Dashboard – US vs India

Project Title

Comparative Analysis of US and Indian Healthcare Systems
Group Project – MS in Business Analytics, UMass Amherst

Project Overview
This project presents a data-driven comparative analysis of the healthcare systems of the United States and India, focused on evaluating key indicators such as healthcare expenditure, life expectancy, maternal mortality, immunization rates, hospital infrastructure, and healthcare workforce. The goal was to identify disparities, policy implications, and opportunities for optimization through visual analytics.

🎯 Objectives
Analyze and compare healthcare quality, accessibility, and efficiency between the U.S. and India

Visualize trends in life expectancy, immunization, maternal and child health

Examine socio-economic and demographic influences on healthcare outcomes

Provide actionable insights for healthcare policymakers, researchers, and strategy professionals

📈 Dashboards & Visuals (Created in Tableau)
The final Tableau dashboards showcase:

📌 Population & Demographics

📌 Life Expectancy Trends (2013–2022)

📌 Maternal Mortality Ratios

📌 Hospital Beds per 1,000 People

📌 Immunization Coverage (DPT, HepB3, Measles)

📌 Physicians per Capita

📌 Healthcare Expenditure: Public vs Private, % of GDP, per Capita

🧠 Key Insights
India’s public health system faces challenges in accessibility, maternal health, and infrastructure, particularly in rural areas

The U.S. system offers advanced infrastructure but suffers from high costs and unequal access

Preventive healthcare (e.g., immunization) shows opportunity for growth in both systems

Both countries face chronic condition burdens and need tailored strategies

International benchmarks and WHO goals highlight the need for collaboration & universal health coverage
